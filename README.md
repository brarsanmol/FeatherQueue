## What is FeatherQueue?
FeatherQueue is a player queueing and load balancing system for the Minecraft layer-7 proxy BungeeCord.

## What inspired FeatherQueue?
Here are a few reasons why FeatherQueue was created when solutions already exist:
* Most queueing and load balancing systems were/are proprietary.
* Solutions that are publicly available are often buggy in their support for player priorities and keeping the queue sorted.
* Solutions did not provide Developer API's.
* Solutions also failed to provide configurable plugin messages. 
* Existing solutions that do function appropriately require the deployment of an in memory cache or message broker. FeatherQueue requires neither of those.

## Features
- Support for game versions 1.7.x - 1.17.x
- Priority based queueing.
- Full configurable, add your own server's theme!
- Fully fledged Developer API.

| Command | Permission | Description |
